# Course Query Example
Uses Node.JS, Express.JS, and Joi to handle CRUD operations for course queries.
1. See courses (get)
2. Update a course (push)
3. Add a course (put)
4. Remove a course (delete)

Nodemon is used to help streamline the process. Joi is version 17.1.1 and is used to help validate client requests.
